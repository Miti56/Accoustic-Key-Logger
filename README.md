## Overview

This Python program allows you to perform keyboard acoustic analysis. By using sophisticated audio processing algorithms, our program can detect key presses simply based on the sound. This has potential applications in accessibility, security, and user interface development.

Through an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI), users can simply upload their audio recordings of typing and see the detected key presses.

## Features

- **Audio recording analysis:** The application can analyze a given audio recording for key press sounds.
- **Keyboard press detection:** Using advanced sound processing algorithms, it's capable of identifying individual key presses and their timings.
- **Intuitive User Interface:** Our application has an easy-to-use and visually pleasing user interface, simplifying the user interaction.
